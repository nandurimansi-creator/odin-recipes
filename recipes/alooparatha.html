    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Aloo Paratha is a popular Indian flatbread stuffed with a spiced potato filling. It is typically served with yogurt, pickles, or butter and is a common breakfast dish in North India.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup boiled and mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water (as needed for dough)</li>
        <li>Ghee or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour with a pinch of salt. Gradually add water and knead to form a soft dough. Cover and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the boiled and mashed potatoes with chopped onions, green chilies, cilantro, cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili powder, and salt. Ensure the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll out one ball into a small circle on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center of the rolled-out dough. Bring the edges together to seal the filling inside and pinch off any excess dough.</li>
        <li>Gently flatten the stuffed dough ball and roll it out again into a larger circle, being careful not to let the filling spill out.</li>
        <li>Heat a tawa or skillet over medium heat. Place the rolled-out paratha on the hot tawa and cook for 1-2 minutes until you see bubbles forming on the surface.</li>
        <li>Flip the paratha and apply ghee or oil on the cooked side. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, then flip again and apply ghee or oil on the other side. Cook until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve hot with yogurt, pickles, or butter. Enjoy your delicious Aloo Paratha!</li>
