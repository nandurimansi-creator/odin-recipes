   <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fish fry is a popular dish made by coating fish fillets in a seasoned batter or breading and then deep-frying them until they are golden brown and crispy. It is often served with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and coleslaw.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb fish fillets (such as cod, tilapia, or catfish)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour the buttermilk into another shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Dip each fish fillet into the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off, then coat it in the seasoned flour mixture. Press the flour onto the fish to ensure it adheres well.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated fish fillets into the hot oil. Fry for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until the fish is golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 145째F (63째C).</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the fish from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the fish fry hot with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and coleslaw on the side. Enjoy!</li>
